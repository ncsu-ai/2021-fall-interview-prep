    "This looks like it would reasonably shuffle the array. However, the issue with this code is that it slightly biases certain outcomes. Consider the following array: [a, b, c]. At each step i, we have three different possible outcomes: switching the element at i with any other index in the array. Since we swap up to three times, we have 3^3 = 27 possible (and equally likely) outcomes. But there are only 6 outcomes, and they all need to be equally likely:\n",

    "Recall that we want every permutation to be equally likely: in other words, any element should have a 1 / n probability to end up in any spot. To make sure each element has 1 / n probability of ending up in any spot, we can do the following:\n",
    "1. Iterate through the array with an index `i`\n",
    "2. Generate a random index j between `i` and `n - 1`\n",
    "3. Swap `A[i]` and `A[j]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this generate a uniform distribution? Let's use a loop invariant to prove this.\n",
    "Our loop invariant will be the following: at each index `i` of our loop, all indices before `i` have an equally random probability of being any element from our array.\n",
    "Consider `i = 1`. Since we are swapping `A[0]` with an index that spans the entire array, `A[0]` has an equally uniform probability of being any element in the array. So our invariant is true in this case.\n",
    "Assume our loop invariant is true until `i` and consider the loop at `i + 1`. Then we should calculate the probability of some element ending up at index `i + 1`.\n",
    "That's equal to the probability of not picking that element up until `i` and then choosing it.\n",
    "All the remaining prospective elements must not have been picked yet, which means it avoided being picked from 0 to `i`. That's a probability of `(n - 1 / n) * (n - 2 / n - 1) * ... * (n - i - 1 / n - i)`.\n",
    "Finally, we need to actually choose it. Since there are `n - i` remaining elements to choose from, that's a probability of `1 / (n - i)`.\n",
    "Putting them together, we have a probability of `(n - 1 / n) * (n - 2 / n - 1) * ... * (n - i - 1 / n - i) * (1 / n - i)`. Notice that everything beautifully cancels out, and we are left with a probability of `1 / n`!\n",
