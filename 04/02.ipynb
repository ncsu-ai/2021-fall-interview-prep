Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. Return null if there's no way to break the text into lines of at most length `k`.\n",

    "We can break up the string greedily. First, we'll break up `s` into an array called `words`. Then, we can use a buffer as a current string and tentatively add words to it, checking that the newly-added-to line can fit within `k`. If we overflow with the new word, then we flush out the current string into an array, `lines`, and restart it with the new word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if any word is longer than `k`, then there's no way to break up the text, so we should return `None`. It's helpful to define a helper function that returns the length of a list of words with spaces added in between.\n",
