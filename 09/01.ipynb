    "### Solution\n",
    "This problem is similar to the LRU cache problem covered in an earlier session this semester, but requires a different perspective. In that problem, we used a doubly linked list of nodes and a hash table that mapped keys to the nodes. When we evicted an entry from the cache, we just had to look at the head of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution, we keep two dictionaries: one mapping from keys to values (and their frequencies), and another mapping from frequency counts to a deque of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we set a key, we first check if we need to evict another key. If we do, then we'll look at the entry in our frequency map with the lowest frequency and pop from the left (since we'll be appending, the left will be the least recently used entry). Then we can add our mapping to the `dict`'s: we'll add our key and value (along with a frequency of one) to our value mapping, and also to our frequency mapping at key 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're updating a key (the key already exists), then it's a different story. Here, we will need to basically only update the value mapping by setting a new value and increment the frequency. For the frequency mapping, we'll need to move our key to the next frequency bucket, creating it if necessary via `defaultdict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a key has similar logic to updating it, without actually updating it."
