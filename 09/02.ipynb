    "# Count Pairs of Attacking Bishops (Google)\n",

    "On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishops located between them (i.e., bishops can attack through pieces).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given `N` bishops, represented as (row, column) `tuples` on a `M` by `M` chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesnâ€™t matter. For example, given `M=5` and the list of bishops: `[(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 2), (4, 0)]`, you should return 2, since bishops 1 & 3 and 3 & 4 attack each other."
